# Site-to-Site-VPN-Tunnel-Emulator
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an enterprise-grade Site-to-Site VPN using GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) tunneling to securely connect geographically separated networks over a public infrastructure.
We implemented a layered security architecture using Access Control Lists (ACLs) to permit only essential traffic, ensuring a default-deny security posture. The network is segmented using multiple subnets for scalability and isolation, while DNS and web services are integrated to simulate real-world enterprise operations.

The system supports:

-Secure GRE tunnel establishment between remote sites
-Controlled traffic flow using extended ACLs
-Network segmentation with efficient subnetting
-DNS-based name resolution for seamless access
-Web service accessibility across sites
-Connectivity, routing, and performance validation using industry-standard tools

This project serves as a practical learning resource for understanding enterprise networking concepts such as VPN tunneling, routing, access control, and service integration, making it ideal for students and networking enthusiasts.
